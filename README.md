# Bio

I am a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, a member of the Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) and the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC). I studied Technical Software Engineering in Computer Science (equivalent to a BSc in Computer Science) and an Engineering in Computer Science (equivalent to an MSc in Computer Science). Additionally, I hold a MSc in Computer Vision and a PhD in Technology. I did all my studies at the University of Girona. 
My research interests are focused on the development of computer assisted interventions, medical image analysis and deep learning.
Currently, I am developing data-driven approaches for the early detection of pancreatic cancer during endoscopy ultrasound interventions (EUS). I have also developed a guidance system for EUS to assist clinicians during navigation and diagnosis of pancreatobiliary disorders.
I am also passionate about teaching and public engagement activities.

# Research projects

## Advanced ultrasound modes for Interventional applications (DOORS)
The aim of the platform DOORS is to create advanced ultrasound modes to facilitate novel advances in ultrasound to be integrated in the clinical setting.

### Synthetic UltraSound Images (SUSI) working group
We have created a method based on CycleGAN to generate synthetic ultrasound images.
We are still working on the public version of the code and the synthetic dataset. 
Please contact me if you wish early access to the code at: e.bonmati-at-ucl.ac.uk.

## Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)

* Optimal ultrasound planes for the initialisation of image registration [[paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11548-018-1762-2)].

* Assessment of electromagnetic tracking accuracy [[paper](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1544341/1/Bonmati%20Coll_assessment%20of%20electromagnetic%20tracking_endoscopic_.pdf)].
